# Live Code Editor

## Overview

This project, created by **Calestial Ashley**, is a **Live Code Editor** that allows users to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. The editor is built with a clean, minimalist interface, making it easy to write and test code snippets directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Three Code Panels:** Separate text areas for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, each with its own labeled panel.
- **Real-Time Output:** The code written in the editor is rendered in real-time in an `iframe` element, showing the output as the user types.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is flexible and adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that structures the layout of the live code editor. It includes the three code panels and the output iframe.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file that styles the editor's layout, including the dark theme, responsive design, and overall look and feel.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that powers the real-time functionality, dynamically updating the iframe's content based on the user's input.

## How to Use

1. **HTML Panel:** Write your HTML code in the first text area. The code will be immediately reflected in the output.
2. **CSS Panel:** Write your CSS in the second text area to style the HTML content.
3. **JavaScript Panel:** Add interactive features or logic in the third text area with JavaScript.
4. **View Output:** The live output is displayed in the iframe below the code panels.

To use this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start coding directly in the editor panels, and see your changes live in the output section.
